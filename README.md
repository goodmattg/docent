Crowdsourced Docent 

Based off of the visual layout and structure of my earlier HATHYST project.
That was a study of front-end techniques - this is going to hit the full-stack. 

The goal is unmoderated commenting using ML based on open-source NLP. Users will share insights on paintings they see and the
platform will aggregate user comments into sensible guides to the artwork. Users will have the ability to upvote/downvote but this will mostly be for unseen rankings - instead heavy ML will pre-filter comments based on the topic at hand.
